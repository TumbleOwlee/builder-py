# BuilderPy
This repository contains a Python utility script that allows to execute any chain of commands based on a yaml configuration file. Based on the directory of the invokation and the configuration given commands are executed.

It created and used this tool while handling multiple projects with completely different setups. Since each project was location in another directory, this tool provided the flexibility to configure the steps to e.g. build and run tests once and use the same command in all projects.
